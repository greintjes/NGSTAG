    community matrix. It can analysis the diveristy within and between sites by
    RICHNESS, EVENESS and DIVERSITY INDECIES, subsequently it can evaluate the
    species occurance. Additionally it can be used for cluster analysis based
    on Bray-Curtis or Jaccard dissimilarity matrixes. Finally it uses the vegan

    factor or contextual data.
